-----------------------issues/ problems---------------------
communication - our biggest issue was communication throughout the weeks of work we learned
how to better communicate as a group and come together to reach a common goal

gitHub/webMAtrix - files were unable to be worked on by two people at the same time 
without causing a merge conflict.

java - originally we wanted to use java as our main language but java doesn’t work in web browsers or 
atleast it doesnt without a large amount of work.

000webhost - our web-host would always shut down and not allow us to input files in it
this problem continued on and off until the end of our project (we even tried looking for other services)
